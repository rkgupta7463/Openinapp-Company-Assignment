# Translation Assignment - English into Hinglish

## 1. Project Overview
##### Hinglish Translation Model
### Introduction

  This project aims to develop a Python-based Hinglish translation model that can convert English text into a simplified form of Hindi and English mixed language, known as Hinglish. The goal is to make the translated text     sound natural and easy to understand for both native Hindi speakers and non-native Hindi speakers.

### Purpose

  The primary purpose of this project is to bridge the language gap between English and Hindi, particularly for users who are more comfortable with a blend of both languages. Hinglish is commonly spoken and used in various   informal and online communication channels, making it essential to provide accurate and fluent translations.

### Features
  1. Translation Accuracy: The model will accurately convert complex English words and phrases into their Hinglish equivalents while preserving simplicity.
  2. Fluency: The translated text will sound natural and colloquial, resembling how a casual Hinglish speaker would express themselves.
  3. Understandability: The Hinglish translations will be easy to comprehend for non-native Hindi speakers and those familiar with the Hinglish dialect.

2. Setup: Provide instructions for setting up the Python environment, installing dependencies, and downloading the spaCy models.

3. Usage: Explain how to use your translation model. Provide code examples for translating English sentences to Hinglish.

4. Evaluation: Describe how to evaluate the model's performance, including criteria for accuracy, fluency, and understandability.

5. Results: Share the results of your model's translations. You can include sample input sentences and their corresponding Hinglish translations.
